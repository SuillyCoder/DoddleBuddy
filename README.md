For context, A.R.T. was a project that I made, which made me realize I was biting off more than I could chew. I was already trying to figure out how to handle big relational data, while also thinking about scalability, while also dealing with multiple users, etc. etc. 

This time around, I'm planning to make it simpler. This project is a simpler version of A.R.T. that aims to help artists get a little break from artblock and get some creative juices flowing. Right now, the app offers 3 main features: artist features, galleries, and prompt generation. 

Overtime, the app can be iterated through in order to be better and better.

Firebase offers multi-service platforms essential to app development, such as hosting, authentication, and databases. It also offers storage, but Cloudinary was the better choice here due
to it being free and the amount of storage if offers (25GB). All framework functionalities are made with NextJS and Tailwind CSS for easier styling. Gemini-2.0-Flash was also used to
include AI-Integration features onto the application.
